Simon Game 
It's a fun and easy game that helps to improve memory skills. Computer creates series of lights and tones (starting from one button) 
and player has to repeat the series. 
If a player input the series right, he gets the same series plus one. If he get wrong everything starts from the beginning. 
A player can win if he input 20 buttons right.
